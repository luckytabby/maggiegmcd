- 👩🏻‍💻 Hi, I’m Maggie!
- 🎨 I'm an artist and designer studying web dev and hoping to make some cool apps and video games.
- ⚛️ I’m currently learning ReactJS and taking courses on graphic design and video game development.
- 🎮 I've also been playing a lot of Stardew Valley and counting that as "research"...
- ✨ I’d love to collaborate with anyone who could use a little bit of creative spice.
- 💌 My email address is maggiegreymcdonald@gmail.com or maggieforhire@gmail.com for specific business inquiries.
